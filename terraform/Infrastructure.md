### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the analysis of the provided files, the project involves deploying a high-availability MySQL cluster architecture on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The architecture is designed to ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient database management using tools like Orchestrator and ProxySQL. The infrastructure spans multiple zones within a single cloud region to achieve high availability.

The key components and their roles in the architecture are as follows:

1. **Client**: The application or service that interacts with the database cluster.
2. **Internal Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic from the client to ProxySQL instances.
3. **ProxySQL**: Manages database traffic, including read and write operations, and routes them to the appropriate database instances.
4. **Source Database**: The primary database instance that handles write operations.
5. **Replica Databases**: Read-only replicas of the source database for load balancing and redundancy.
6. **Orchestrator**: Monitors the database cluster, manages failover, and ensures the health of the cluster.
7. **Orchestrator Database**: Stores metadata and configuration details for the orchestrator.

The architecture also includes connections for traffic routing, replication, and monitoring.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### 1. **Cloud Provider**
   - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

#### 2. **Region and Zones**
   - **Region**: A single GCP region (e.g., `us-central1` or `europe-west1`).
   - **Zones**: At least three zones within the selected region (e.g., `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c`).

#### 3. **Networking**
   - **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
     - A dedicated VPC for the database cluster to ensure isolation and security.
   - **Subnets**:
     - Subnets in each zone for deploying the components.
   - **Internal Load Balancer**:
     - An internal TCP/UDP load balancer to route traffic from the client to ProxySQL instances.
   - **Firewall Rules**:
     - Allow traffic between components (e.g., client to load balancer, ProxySQL to databases, orchestrator to databases).
     - Restrict external access to the VPC.

#### 4. **Compute Resources**
   - **ProxySQL Instances**:
     - At least two instances for high availability, deployed across different zones.
     - Instance type: `e2-medium` or higher, depending on traffic requirements.
   - **Source Database**:
     - A single instance in Zone A.
     - Instance type: `db-n1-standard-2` or higher, depending on workload.
   - **Replica Databases**:
     - At least one replica in Zone B.
     - Instance type: Same as the source database.
   - **Orchestrator**:
     - A single instance in Zone C.
     - Instance type: `e2-small` or higher.
   - **Orchestrator Database**:
     - A small database instance (e.g., `db-f1-micro`) for storing metadata and configuration.

#### 5. **Storage**
   - **Source Database**:
     - Persistent disk with SSD for high IOPS.
     - Size: 100 GB or more, depending on data requirements.
   - **Replica Databases**:
     - Persistent disk with SSD.
     - Size: Same as the source database.
   - **Orchestrator Database**:
     - Persistent disk with SSD.
     - Size: 10 GB or more.
   - **Backup Storage**:
     - Cloud Storage bucket for automated backups of the source database.

#### 6. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
   - **Multi-Zone Deployment**:
     - Distribute components across multiple zones to ensure availability during zone failures.
   - **Database Replication**:
     - Enable replication from the source database to replicas.
   - **Orchestrator**:
     - Configure failover mechanisms to promote a replica to the source database in case of failure.

#### 7. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Cloud Monitoring**:
     - Enable monitoring for all components (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage, network traffic).
   - **Cloud Logging**:
     - Collect logs from ProxySQL, databases, and the orchestrator for troubleshooting and auditing.
   - **Orchestrator Monitoring**:
     - Configure heartbeat signals and alerts for database health.

#### 8. **Security**
   - **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
     - Restrict access to the infrastructure components based on roles (e.g., database admin, network admin).
   - **Encryption**:
     - Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
   - **Service Accounts**:
     - Use dedicated service accounts for each component with minimal required permissions.

#### 9. **Scalability**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**:
     - Add more ProxySQL instances or replica databases as needed.
   - **Vertical Scaling**:
     - Increase instance types for ProxySQL, source database, or replicas based on performance requirements.

#### 10. **Backup and Recovery**
   - **Automated Backups**:
     - Schedule daily backups of the source database to a Cloud Storage bucket.
   - **Point-in-Time Recovery**:
     - Enable point-in-time recovery for the source database.

#### 11. **Cost Optimization**
   - **Preemptible Instances**:
     - Use preemptible instances for non-critical components like replicas or orchestrator to reduce costs.
   - **Resource Sizing**:
     - Regularly monitor resource usage and adjust instance types or disk sizes to avoid over-provisioning.

### Additional Notes
- The architecture assumes a single-region deployment for simplicity. If global availability is required, additional regions and inter-region replication should be considered.
- The infrastructure should be managed using Terraform or a similar Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to ensure consistency and repeatability.
