Content: The diagram represents a high-availability MySQL cluster architecture deployed on Google Cloud using Orchestrator and ProxySQL. The architecture includes multiple zones within a cloud region and describes the components and their interactions.  

Key components identified:
1. **Client**: Connects to the system via an internal load balancer.
2. **Internal Load Balancer (Cloud Load Balancer)**: Routes traffic to ProxySQL instances.
3. **ProxySQL Instances**: Handle autoscaling and direct read/write operations to the database instances.
4. **Source Compute Engine Instance**: Primary database instance for write operations, replicates data to the Replica instance.
5. **Replica Compute Engine Instance**: Read-only database instance for read operations.
6. **Orchestrator Instances**: Autoscaling instances responsible for cluster management and failover capabilities.
7. **Orchestrator Database (Cloud SQL)**: Stores metadata and configuration for Orchestrator.
8. **Zones**: 
   - Zone A: Hosts the Source Compute Engine instance and ProxySQL instances.
   - Zone B: Hosts the Replica Compute Engine instance.
   - Zone C: Hosts the Orchestrator instances and Orchestrator database.

Key interactions:
- Client-to-load balancer connections.
- Load balancer-to-ProxySQL connections.
- ProxySQL-to-Source and ProxySQL-to-Replica connections for database operations.
- Replication from Source to Replica.
- Orchestrator-to-database and Orchestrator-to-Source/Replica connections for monitoring and control.

### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the analysis, the following cloud infrastructure components are required:

#### Compute Resources
1. **Source Compute Engine Instance**:
   - Zone: A
   - Role: Primary database instance for write operations.
   - Requirements: High-performance machine type, sufficient disk space for database storage, and network access for replication and Orchestrator communication.

2. **Replica Compute Engine Instance**:
   - Zone: B
   - Role: Read-only database instance for read operations.
   - Requirements: Similar machine type and disk space as the Source instance, optimized for read operations.

3. **ProxySQL Instances**:
   - Zones: A and C
   - Role: Handle autoscaling and direct database operations.
   - Requirements: Autoscaling enabled, lightweight machine type optimized for routing traffic.

4. **Orchestrator Instances**:
   - Zone: C
   - Role: Cluster management and failover capabilities.
   - Requirements: Autoscaling enabled, lightweight machine type optimized for monitoring and control.

#### Networking Resources
1. **Internal Load Balancer (Cloud Load Balancer)**:
   - Role: Routes traffic from clients to ProxySQL instances.
   - Requirements: Internal load balancing configuration, high availability.

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Subnets: Separate subnets for each zone to isolate components.
   - Firewall Rules: Allow traffic between components (e.g., ProxySQL to Source/Replica, Orchestrator to Source/Replica).

#### Storage Resources
1. **Persistent Disks**:
   - Attached to Source and Replica Compute Engine instances.
   - Requirements: SSD for high IOPS, sufficient capacity for database storage.

2. **Cloud SQL Instance**:
   - Zone: C
   - Role: Orchestrator database.
   - Requirements: High availability configuration, sufficient storage for metadata and configuration.

#### High Availability and Scalability
1. **Multi-Zone Deployment**:
   - Zones: A, B, and C.
   - Role: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Autoscaling**:
   - ProxySQL and Orchestrator instances should be configured for autoscaling to handle varying workloads.

#### Monitoring and Logging
1. **Cloud Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Role: Monitor the health and performance of all components.
   - Requirements: Enable monitoring for Compute Engine instances, Cloud SQL, and load balancer.

#### Security
1. **IAM Roles and Permissions**:
   - Role: Restrict access to resources based on least privilege.
   - Requirements: Define roles for database administrators, network engineers, and application developers.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Role: Secure data in transit and at rest.
   - Requirements: Enable SSL/TLS for database connections and encrypt persistent disks.
