### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the analysis of the provided files, the project requires a robust cloud infrastructure to support high availability, scalability, monitoring, and redundancy. The infrastructure spans multiple zones within a Google Cloud region and includes components for compute, storage, networking, monitoring, and database management.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### **1. Compute Resources**
- **Primary Compute Engine Instances**:
  - Deployed in Zone A as part of a stateful managed instance group (MIG-A).
  - Responsible for read and write operations.
  - Connected to a persistent disk for storage.
  - Interacts with a regional persistent disk for redundancy.
- **Failover Compute Engine Instances**:
  - Deployed in Zone B as part of a stateful managed instance group (MIG-B).
  - Acts as a failover virtual machine (VM) in case of primary instance failure.
- **Autoscaling**:
  - ProxySQL instances in Zone A and Zone C should support autoscaling to handle varying workloads.

#### **2. Storage Resources**
- **Persistent Disks**:
  - Primary persistent disk attached to the Compute Engine instance in Zone A.
  - Regional persistent disk for redundancy across zones.
- **Cloud Storage**:
  - Used to store the state of the managed instance groups (MIGs) for persistence and recovery.
- **Database Storage**:
  - Source database in Zone A for write operations.
  - Read-only replica database in Zone B for read operations.
  - Orchestrator database in Zone C for storing metadata and operational data.

#### **3. Networking Resources**
- **Load Balancers**:
  - Cloud Load Balancer for external traffic routing to the primary Compute Engine instance.
  - Internal Load Balancer for routing traffic to ProxySQL instances.
- **Static IP Address**:
  - Assigned to the primary Compute Engine instance for consistent external access.
- **Health Checks**:
  - Configured to monitor the status of Compute Engine instances and ensure high availability.

#### **4. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Dedicated instances for deploying Prometheus for monitoring.
  - Dedicated instances for deploying Grafana for visualization.
- **Logging**:
  - Centralized logging to track events and system performance.

#### **5. Messaging and Automation**
- **Pub/Sub**:
  - Used for messaging between components.
- **Cloud Functions**:
  - Deployed for automated tasks and event-driven workflows.

#### **6. Database Management**
- **MySQL Cluster**:
  - High-availability MySQL cluster using Orchestrator and ProxySQL.
  - Orchestrator monitors the cluster and manages failover between the source and replica databases.
  - ProxySQL handles routing of read and write operations and supports autoscaling.

#### **7. High Availability and Redundancy**
- **Multi-Zone Deployment**:
  - All critical components are distributed across multiple zones (Zone A, Zone B, and Zone C) within a single region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Failover Mechanisms**:
  - Orchestrator manages failover for the MySQL cluster.
  - Stateful managed instance groups (MIGs) provide failover for Compute Engine instances.

#### **8. Security**
- **Access Control**:
  - IAM roles and policies to restrict access to resources.
- **Network Security**:
  - Firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic to and from the instances.
- **Data Encryption**:
  - Persistent disks and database storage should be encrypted at rest.

#### **9. Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - ProxySQL instances and Compute Engine instances should support horizontal scaling to handle increased traffic.
- **Vertical Scaling**:
  - Persistent disks and database instances should support vertical scaling for increased storage and performance needs.

#### **10. Additional Considerations**
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Regular backups of databases and persistent disks.
  - Disaster recovery plan to restore services in case of a region-wide failure.
- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Use of preemptible instances where applicable.
  - Monitoring of resource usage to avoid over-provisioning.
